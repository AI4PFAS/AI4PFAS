## Context
 - **Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroaklyl** *(PFAS)* - a family of organic industrial synthetics of increasing federal concern for unknown hazards and widespread contamination of DOD & DOE sites
 - **Acute oral rat toxicity** *(LD50)* - a nonspecific quantification of toxicity which measures the minimum 24-hr drug dose to induce 50% lethality in a sample of labratory rats
 - **LDToxDB** - shorthand for the compiled LD50 dataset

## Dataset
LDToxDB was created by compiling LD50 datasets from the [EPA Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (TEST)](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-estimation-software-tool-test), [NIH Collaborative Acute Toxicity Modeling Suite (CATMoS)](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/iccvamreport/2019/technology/comp-tools-dev/catmos/index.html), and National Toxicology Program (NTP). Values represent experimental LD50 measurements in -log(mol/kg). Chemical duplicates were identified by InChIKey and removed.

## Installation
### Requirements
The workflow requires Python 3.7 and relevant packages. Install Anaconda and run the following terminal commands to create an environment based on the repository requirements:
~~~
(base) $ conda create -n ai4pfas -f environment.yml
(base) $ conda activate ai4pfas
~~~

### Running the repo
Start a Jupyter Notebook instance from the terminal and navigate within the UI to execute `.ipynb` files.
~~~
(ai4pfas) $ jupyter notebook
~~~

Python files are directly executable from within the terminal.
~~~
(ai4pfas) $ python ./src/deep-ensemble.py
~~~
